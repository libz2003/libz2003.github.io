# Remark

Th 1 is one of the exercise problems in COMPLEX ANALYSIS by E.Stein(it is the last problem before the appendix). but the book only provide sketch of the solution, so I fill in details in this note.

Th 1:  $r_8(n) = 16\sigma_3^*(n)$  
where

$r_8(n) = \\#\left\\{(x1, x2, ..., x8)\in|\sum x_i^2=n\right\\}$  

$16\sigma_3^*(n) =
\begin{cases}
\sigma_3(n)& \text{n is odd}\newline
\sum_d|n& \text{n is even}
\end{cases}$
